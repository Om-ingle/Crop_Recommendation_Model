# Crop Recommendation Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to recommend suitable crops for cultivation based on various environmental and soil factors.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `results/`: Results of model predictions and evaluations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Tools & Technology Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered environmental and soil data relevant to crop growth.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the data to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Model Training**: Developed and trained machine learning models to predict suitable crops.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the models using various metrics.
6. **Prediction**: Used the trained models to make crop recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Om-ingle/Crop_Recommendation_Model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Crop_Recommendation_Model
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and train the model.
3. Use the scripts in the `src/` directory to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.
4. Evaluate the model performance using the results in the `results/` directory.
